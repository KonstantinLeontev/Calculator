# Calculator
Test assignment for creating simple MFC application.
Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. There's no adjusted keyboard input, so it's better to use screen buttons.
The MATRIX CALC button is for matrix multiplication in popup dialog window - this one for 4 x 4 matricies only at the moment.
